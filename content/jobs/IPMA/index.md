- The work I executed in IPMA was within the [PNAB](https://www.ipma.pt/pt/investigacao/pescas/projetos.detail.html?f=/pt/investigacao/pescas/PNAB.html), I was able to take part in the process of sampling both in the laboratory and in the auction centre
- The sampling in the auction centre consisted in measuring every individual of one ship, that was chosen randomly
- In the laboratory, the sampling process consisted in opening every individual, removing the stomach, the liver and the gonads, weigh the individual before and after removing the guts and then weigh the stomach, liver and gonads. The state of maturity was determined and all the collected data was then analyzed in Excel
- This way it was possible to decide how the species in the portuguese coast were developing and if it was important to stop fishing some species

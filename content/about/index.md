I recently graduated from [Instituto de Ciências Biomédicas](https://sigarra.up.pt/icbas/pt/web_page.inicial) [Abel Salazar](https://sigarra.up.pt/icbas/pt/web_page.inicial), aquatic mammals were my main passion and the reason I enrolled in the Aquatic Sciences course, however, throughout the years I realized how the ocean was being disrespected and mistreated. So i started to make some changes in my lifestyle and tried to raise awareness between my family and group of friends. Step by step.

While I decide the next step for me, I started to learn about programming,which is a useful addition to my course, and web development.
